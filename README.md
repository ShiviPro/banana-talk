# banana-talk

Want to talk to a friendly neighbourhood minion, but can't 'cause you don't know how to ?

Introducing banana-talk, a web app which can help you convert anything spelled in english, to be converted into banana language.

Speak as much minionese as you want, without your neighbouring minion judging you.
